# Jonas Pleyer
## Biology, Physics, Code and Life

I'm a doctoral candidate at the University of Freiburg in Physics,
working on computational models to study cellular behaviour, pattern formation and
self-organization in complex biological cellular systems.
My background is in theoretical physics.
To me, Programming and Mathematics are more than just a set of tools.
