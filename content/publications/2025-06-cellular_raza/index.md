`cellular_raza` is a cellular agent-based modeling framework which allows researchers to construct
models from a clean slate.
In contrast to other agent-based modeling toolkits, cellular_raza was designed to be free of
assumptions about the underlying cellular representation.
This enables researchers to build up complex models while retaining full control over every
parameter introduced.
It comes with predefined building blocks for agents and their physical domain to quickly construct
new simulations bottom-up. Furthermore, `cellular_raza` can be used with the pyo3 and maturin
packages and thus act as a numerical backend to a Python package.
