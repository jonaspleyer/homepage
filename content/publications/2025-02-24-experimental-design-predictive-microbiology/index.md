The aim of predictive microbiology is the provision of tools and methods for predicting the growth,
survival, and death of microorganisms in different food matrices under a range of environmental
conditions.
The parametrized mathematical models need to be calibrated using dedicated experimental data.
In order to efficiently plan experiments, model-based experimental design is used.
In this chapter, we explain model-based experimental design and provide step-by-step instructions
for finding the optimal design using the well-known Baranyi-Roberts growth model as an example.
We provide the Python software eDPM for Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)-based models, such that
the reader can apply model-based experimental design in their research context.
