This thesis calculates the special-relativistic internal energy of a non-interacting gas.
We derive an equation of state (EoS) which we apply to the Tollmann-Oppenheimer Volkoff (TOV)
equation.
Furthermore we present numerical results of the TOV equation for various configurations of a
polytropic EoS.
These results show that the zero values of the TOV equation compared to its non-relativistic
counterpart, the Lane-Emden (LE) equation, are smaller for identical parameters.
We present initial developments to a proof of this theorem.
Furthermore, an additional exact solution and index $n=2$ of the LE equation was discovered.
