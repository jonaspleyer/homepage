I am excited to share that I will be participating in this years iGEM competition as a supervisor. I will advise the studentsâ€™ who are modeling their experimental setup. We aim to establish a concise model and acquire relevant parameters in a timely manner. This will probably be a more demanding task than initially believed That being said, the iGEM Freiburg Team is very motivated and I hope to be sharing more details in the coming months.
